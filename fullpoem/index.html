            &emsp;    Changed? Yes, I will confess it - I have changed.<br>
        I do not love in the old fond way.<br>
        &emsp;    I am your friend still - time has not estranged<br>
        One kindly feeling of that vanished day.<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;     But the bright glamour which made life a dream,<br>
        The rapture of that time, its sweet content,<br>
        &emsp;    Like visions of a sleeper's brain they seem -<br>
        And yet I cannot tell you how they went.<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;    Why do you gaze with such accusing eyes<br>
        Upon me, dear? Is it so very strange<br>
        &emsp;    That hearts, like all things underneath God's skies<br>
        Should sometimes feel the influence of change?<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;    The birds, the flowers, the foliage of the trees,<br>
        The stars which seem so fixed and so sublime,<br>
        &emsp;    Vast continents and the eternal seas -<br>
        All these do change with ever-changing time.<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;    The face our mirror shows us year on year<br>
        Is not the same; our dearest aim or need,<br>
        &emsp;    Our lightest thought or feeling, hope or fear,<br>
        All, all the law of alteration heed.<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;    How can we ask the human heart to stay<br>
        Content with fancies of Youth's earliest hours?<br>
        &emsp;    The year outgrows the violets of May,<br>
        Although, maybe, there are no fairer flowers.<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;    And life may hold no sweeter love than this,<br>
        Which lies so cold, so voiceless, and so dumb.<br>
        &emsp;    And shall I miss it, dear? Why, yes, we miss<br>
        The violets always - till the roses come!<br><br><br>
